<dt>6.2 HDFS Design</dt>
<dl>Following are the properties of HDFS which makes it different from other file systems and which make HDFS capable of handling
very large amount of data reliably.</dl>

<dt>6.2.1 System failures</dt>
<dl>HDFS is designed to work on a set of commodity hardware. System failures are considered a norm. As there are a large number
of components on which HDFS rely on, considering these components have a non-trivial probability of failure will also result in
one component or the other failing all the time. So HDFS is designed to detect the failures and perform automatic recovery in
order to provide required performance is one of the core properties of HDFS.</dl>
</ol>
<dt>6.2.2 Can handle large amount of data</dt>
<dl>HDFS is designed to be used with applications which depend on a large amount of data. This data can be in gigabytes, terabytes
or petabytes also. So HDFS is tuned to support such large data sets and to scale to a large cluster of systems to store this data
without compromising with the data thoughput.</dl>
